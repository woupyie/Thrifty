Building an android Thrift Shop

Thanks to @alizeb438 from Coding Cafe for a great tutorial.

For material design components I used <a href="https://github.com/rey5137/material">Rey Phams Library</a>.

I also made use of <a href ="https://github.com/pilgr/Paper" >Paper Library</a> to implement Remember Me for the user.
